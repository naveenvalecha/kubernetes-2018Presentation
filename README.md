# Kubernetes 2018 Presentation
Thanks to everyone who came to my Atlanta Codecamp 2018 "Deploying Applications on Kubernetes" presentation.

I've updated the slides to the ones that I used on Saturday.

I'll be uploading my script files later this week and althogh I didn't get to it on Saturday, one of my demos wasn't working. I'll fix it and upload it also when I figure out the problem.

If you put a watch on this repo, you'll get updates when I upload the additional files.
